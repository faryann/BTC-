Abstract. We evaluated a famouse trading strategy known as moving averages using Bitcoin (BTC) price data. 
Our conclusion is that employing this strategy alone does not yield strong performance.

Discription: 

# A widely-used strategy in trading involves comparing Moving Averages (MAs). 

# In financial markets, MA represents the average price of an asset over a specific period, typically measured in a certain number of data-points (e.g., days, 4 hours, or 1 hour).

# The fundamental concept behind this strategy is that every system tends to revert to its mean.

# A trader assesses the MA over an extended timeframe and compares it to the MA over a shorter one.

# When the short MA crosses above the long MA, it is commonly regarded as a buying signal.

# In this study, we examine the performance of this strategy on Bitcoin (BTC) price data dating back to 2018.

# ============================================ Summary of findings =========================================

# Our analysis revealed that the maximum return achieved through this strategy is approximately 11 times the original investment.

# Additionally, we compared this return to that of an individual who bought Bitcoin (BTC) at its lowest price since 2018 and sold it at the highest price BTC has ever reached. In this case, the return amounted to around 20 times the original investment.

# Our conclusion is clear: when employed in isolation, the MA strategy falls short in comparison to a straightforward 'buy low, sell high' approach.

# Furthermore, our findings suggest that the optimal parameters for the MA strategy are a short MA period of 5 days and a long MA period of 125 days
